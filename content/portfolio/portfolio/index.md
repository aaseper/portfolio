[This project](https://github.com/aaseper/portfolio) provides a solution for automatically deploying and maintaining a Hugo static website portfolio. It leverages GitHub Actions to set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline. This pipeline automates the entire process, from building your website to deploying it to GitHub Pages.

The benefits are twofold: it saves you time and effort by eliminating manual steps, and it reduces the risk of errors by ensuring a consistent and automated deployment process. The included architecture diagram provides a clear visualization of this workflow, highlighting the steps involved when you push code changes: building for production, uploading the built website, and finally deploying it to be accessible online.
