[This Unity project](https://github.com/aaseper/multiplayer-videogame-relay-netcode) showcases concurrent programming to achieve a smooth and engaging experience. It utilizes a listen server architecture with centralized control for efficient gameplay coordination. Additionally, techniques like Dead Reckoning (predicting player movement) and Rubber Banding (keeping lagging players in contention) are employed to enhance the experience. Netcode for GameObjects facilitates communication between players, while the relay service ensures connections without the need for dedicated servers or complex peer-to-peer (p2p) management.
