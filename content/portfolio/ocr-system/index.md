[This well-documented Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/aaseper/ocr-system-python/blob/main/ocr_system.ipynb) establishes the foundation for building a system that automatically extracts crucial information, such as warnings and directions, from highway signs. The notebook guides users through the development process with clear, step-by-step explanations, making it accessible for those new to the field.
